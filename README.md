# Vol1 - Chat with my Energy Asset Unstructured Data
Energy companies generate and rely on vast volumes of unstructured data—geological surveys, well logs, seismic interpretations, and production or drilling reports—often stored in PDFs, scanned documents, and images. These data sources hold critical insights, but extracting and interpreting them manually is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient.<br><br>

This solution leverages the power of Microsoft Copilot and Copilot Studio to create intelligent, task-specific Copilot Agents that transform how energy companies access, analyze, and act on their unstructured data. By combining advanced AI, natural language understanding, and seamless integration with Microsoft 365 and Azure ecosystems, these agents automate data extraction, interpretation, and insight generation—turning static documents into dynamic intelligence.

With this solution, energy professionals can:

Ask natural language questions and receive grounded, document-backed answers.
Summarize complex reports like drilling logs or seismic interpretations in seconds.
Visualize trends and anomalies across wells, formations, and time periods.
Collaborate across teams using familiar tools like Teams, SharePoint, and Power BI.
Whether you're optimizing drilling performance, assessing geological risk, or streamlining regulatory reporting, this Copilot-powered solution brings clarity, speed, and intelligence to your most valuable—but underutilized—data assets.

This solution accelerator leverages the full power of Agentic AI to showcase the integration of Copilot agents with energy data. Play the video below to watch the "Chat with your Energy Asset" Sizzler.
